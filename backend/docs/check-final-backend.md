- [ ] **Implement remaining non-auth mock endpoints**
  - [x] Complete implementation of `/api/users/:id/preferences` endpoints
  - [x] Complete implementation of `/api/users/:id/statistics` endpoints
  - [x] Complete implementation of `/api/users/:id/performance` endpoint

  - [ ] Implement request logging for critical operations

## High (Required for MVP release)

- [ ] **Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation**
  - [ ] Set up Swagger UI integration
  - [ ] Add OpenAPI annotations to all business controllers
  - [ ] Document request/response schemas

  - [ ] Set up log rotation
  - [ ] Configure appropriate log levels for different environments
  - [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not logged

- [ ] **Prepare for Railway deployment**
  - [ ] Create deployment configuration files
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for production
  - [ ] Set up database migration scripts
  - [ ] Create deployment pipeline
  - [ ] Test deployment in staging environment

- [ ] **Fix all linting issues**
  - [ ] Run linter with auto-fix where possible
  - [ ] Fix remaining linting errors manually
  - [ ] Remove console.log statements from production code
  - [ ] Fix TypeScript typing issues

## Medium (Important but not blocking)

- [ ] **Improve repository implementations**
  - [x] Fix error handling in repository layer
  - [ ] Improve transaction support
  - [ ] Add missing repository methods
  - [ ] Optimize database queries

- [ ] **Enhance validation**

  - [x] Validate query parameters consistently
  - [ ] Add validation for pagination and sorting parameters

- [ ] **Implement basic security measures**
  - [ ] Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
  - [x] Implement proper CORS configuration
  - [x] Add request validation middleware
  - [x] Configure security headers

## Low (Optional for MVP)

- [ ] **Performance optimizations**
  - [ ] Add query caching for expensive operations
  - [ ] Optimize database indexes
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling optimizations
  - [ ] Add response compression

- [ ] **Add testing improvements**
  - [ ] Increase test coverage to 70%+
  - [x] Add more edge case tests
  - [ ] Implement E2E testing
  - [ ] Create performance/load tests

- [ ] **Documentation enhancements**
  - [ ] Create detailed API usage examples
  - [ ] Document integration patterns
  - [ ] Create backend architecture documentation
  - [ ] Document database schema

## Post-MVP Recommendations

- [ ] Implement advanced monitoring with metrics collection
- [ ] Add distributed tracing for request flows
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- [ ] Add caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Set up automated performance testing
- [ ] Implement versioning strategy for the API
- [ ] Create a comprehensive data backup strategy
- [ ] Add support for WebSockets for real-time updates
