# Backend Test Improvements

## Completed Improvements

### Environment Configuration
- Fixed test environment configuration to properly use `.env.test` file
- Added proper environment variable loading in setup.ts with absolute path resolution
- Added verification of DATABASE_URL to ensure test database is used
- Removed hardcoded database credentials in all test files
- Added masking of sensitive database URLs in logs

### Test Data Management
- Implemented proper test data setup and teardown processes
- Added cleanup functions to ensure tests don't pollute the database
- Fixed database constraint violations in repository tests

### Test Scripts
- Created distinct npm scripts for different test types:
  - `npm run test:unit` - Runs all unit tests
  - `npm run test:unit:watch` - Runs unit tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:infrastructure` - Runs all infrastructure tests
  - `npm run test:infrastructure:watch` - Runs infrastructure tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test:routes` - Runs route integration tests
  - `npm run test:routes:watch` - Runs route integration tests in watch mode
  - `npm run test` - Runs all tests

## Outstanding Issues

### Supabase Mocking
- Jest has issues with the Supabase mock implementation
- ReferenceError in routes tests when accessing variables outside of mock scope
- Fixed by restructuring the mock to contain all necessary code within the mock factory function

### Route Integration Tests
- HTTP status code mismatches in tournament and preference routes
- Integration tests expect specific status codes that don't match controller implementations
- Tests need to be updated to match the actual behavior or controllers need to be fixed

### Dependency Injection
- Issues with dependency injection in route tests
- Missing mock implementations for some use cases
- Need to create proper mocks for all dependencies used in tests

## Next Steps
1. Fix the remaining Supabase mock implementation issues
2. Update route tests to match controller implementations
3. Create proper mock implementations for all use cases
4. Run the full test suite again to verify all tests pass

## Best Practices for Future Tests
1. Always use environment variables for configuration, never hardcode
2. Create reusable test data factories and cleanup utilities
3. Structure tests with proper setup and teardown
4. Mock external dependencies consistently
5. Run tests in isolation to prevent interference
